    max_hours = 100
    metadata = {
      foo : "bar"
    }
  }

  relationships {
    stock_location_id  = commercelayer_stock_location.incentro_stock_location.id
    shipping_method_id = commercelayer_shipping_method.incentro_shipping_method.id
  }
}

resource "commercelayer_address" "incentro_address" {
