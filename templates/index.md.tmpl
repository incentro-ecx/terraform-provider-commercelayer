## Commercial support

## Installation
Terraform automatically downloads providers from the terraform registry. Add the following to your terraform project

```hcl
terraform {
    required_providers {
        commercelayer = {
            version = ">= 0.0.1"
            source  = "incentro-dc/commercelayer"
        }
    }
}
```

Packages of the releases are available at [the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/incentro-dc/terraform-provider-commercelayer/releases).
See the [terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins)
for more information about installing third-party providers.

## Using the provider
The provider attempts to read the required values from environment variables:
- `COMMERCELAYER_CLIENT_ID`
- `COMMERCELAYER_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `COMMERCELAYER_API_ENDPOINT`
- `COMMERCELAYER_AUTH_ENDPOINT`
- `COMMERCELAYER_RATE_LIMITER`

Alternatively, you can set it up directly in the terraform file:

```hcl
provider "commercelayer" {
    client_id     = "<client_id>"
    client_secret = "<client_secret>"
    api_endpoint  = "<api_endpoint>"
    auth_endpoint = "<auth_endpoint>"
    rate_limiter  = "true|false"
}
```
